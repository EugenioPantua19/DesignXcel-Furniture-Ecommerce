# ✅ 3D Products Cart Context Loading Fixed

## Issue
The console was logging cart context objects improperly, showing:
```
Cart context loaded: ObjectaddToCart: "function"[[Prototype]]: Object
```

This was confusing and not helpful for debugging.

## Solution Applied

### Fixed Console Logging in ThreeDProductsPage.js

**Before:**
```javascript
console.log('3D Products - Cart context loaded:', { addToCart: typeof addToCart });
```

**After:**
```javascript
console.log('3D Products - Cart context loaded:', addToCart ? 'OK' : 'MISSING');
console.log('3D Products - addToCart type:', typeof addToCart);
```

## What Changed

1. **Simplified logging**: Now shows "OK" or "MISSING" for clear status
2. **Separate type check**: Logs the function type separately
3. **Better debugging**: More useful output for developers

## New Console Output

**Good (when cart is loaded):**
```
3D Products - Cart context loaded: OK
3D Products - addToCart type: function
```

**Bad (when cart is missing):**
```
3D Products - Cart context loaded: MISSING
3D Products - addToCart type: undefined
```

## File Modified
- `frontend/src/features/3d-products/pages/ThreeDProductsPage.js` (Line 413-414)

## Status: ✅ Fixed

The console logging is now clean and provides useful debugging information without object stringification issues.
