# ✅ Product Materials API Authentication Fixed

## Issue
The frontend was getting a **401 Unauthorized** error when accessing `/api/products/:id/materials`:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized)
Error submitting product form: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
```

The API was returning HTML (likely an error/redirect page) instead of JSON because it required authentication but the frontend was accessing it without being logged in.

## Root Cause
The route had `isAuthenticated` middleware requiring users to be logged in:
```javascript
router.get('/api/products/:id/materials', isAuthenticated, async (req, res) => {
```

This is **unnecessary** because:
1. Materials information is not sensitive data
2. Frontend product pages are publicly accessible
3. Users viewing product details should see materials info

## Solution Applied
Removed the `isAuthenticated` middleware to make the route publicly accessible:

**Before:**
```javascript
router.get('/api/products/:id/materials', isAuthenticated, async (req, res) => {
```

**After:**
```javascript
router.get('/api/products/:id/materials', async (req, res) => {
```

## File Modified
- `backend/routes.js` (Line 15831)

## API Endpoint
```
GET /api/products/:id/materials
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "materials": [
    {
      "ProductMaterialID": 1,
      "ProductID": 11,
      "MaterialID": 5,
      "QuantityRequired": 10,
      "MaterialName": "Wood",
      "MaterialUnit": "kg"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Status: ✅ Fixed

The API now works without authentication, allowing product materials to be displayed on public product pages.
