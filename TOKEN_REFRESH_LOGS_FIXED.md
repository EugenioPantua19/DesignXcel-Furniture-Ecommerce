# âœ… Token Refresh Console Logs Fixed

## Issue
The console was flooded with "Access token expired, attempting refresh..." messages:
```
ðŸ”„ Access token expired, attempting refresh...
apiClient.js:41 ðŸ”„ Access token expired, attempting refresh...
apiClient.js:41 ðŸ”„ Access token expired, attempting refresh...
```

This was happening repeatedly for every API request, creating unnecessary console noise.

## Root Cause
The `isTokenExpired()` check was logging to console for **every single API request** when the token was expired, even though:
1. The request still goes through successfully
2. The response interceptor handles the refresh
3. The logging was not helpful for debugging

## Solution Applied
Made the logging conditional on debug mode:

**Before:**
```javascript
if (this.isTokenExpired(token)) {
  console.log('ðŸ”„ Access token expired, attempting refresh...');
  // Don't block the request, let the response interceptor handle refresh
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
if (this.isTokenExpired(token)) {
  // Silently handle expired token - let the response interceptor handle refresh
  // Only log in debug mode to reduce console noise
  if (apiConfig.debugMode) {
    console.log('ðŸ”„ Access token expired, attempting refresh...');
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Console Noise**: No more repeated token expiration messages
2. **Cleaner Debugging**: Real errors are more visible
3. **Conditional Logging**: Only logs in debug mode for actual debugging
4. **Better UX**: Less confusing console output for developers

## How It Works Now

- **Normal Mode**: Silent token refresh (no console logs)
- **Debug Mode**: Logs token refresh attempts for debugging
- **Functionality**: All token refresh logic still works as before

## File Modified
- `frontend/src/shared/services/api/apiClient.js` (Lines 40-45)

## Status: âœ… Fixed

Console logs are now clean and only show when debug mode is enabled.
