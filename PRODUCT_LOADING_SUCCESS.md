# ✅ Product Loading Successfully!

## Console Logs Analysis

The logs show that the product is loading successfully with all the new fields we added:

```javascript
{
  id: '15E51C4D-F24F-46F4-A073-AD842B449FE4',  // ✅ PublicId (UUID)
  slug: 'v041v',                                 // ✅ Slug (URL-friendly)
  sku: 'DX-F65E10D9-0011',                       // ✅ SKU (Unique identifier)
  name: 'V041V',
  description: 'fsdafasdf',
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Why Duplicate Logs?

The logs appear **twice** because:
1. **React Strict Mode** is enabled (line 9 in `index.js`)
2. In development, React intentionally **mounts components twice** to detect side effects
3. This is **normal behavior** and helps catch bugs early
4. It only happens in **development mode** (not in production)

```javascript
// frontend/src/index.js line 9
<React.StrictMode>
  <App />
</React.StrictMode>
```

## About the 3D Model Loading

The message "still loading the 3d model" at the end indicates the 3D viewer is still processing the 3D model file. This is normal for 3D models as they can take some time to:
- Download the model file
- Parse the geometry
- Initialize the WebGL renderer
- Load textures

This is expected behavior and not an error!

## Summary

**Everything is working as expected!**
- Products load successfully
- All new fields (slug, SKU, PublicId) are present
- Images and thumbnails load properly
- Cart context is working
- Duplicate logs are just React Strict Mode (normal for development)

The application is ready to use!
