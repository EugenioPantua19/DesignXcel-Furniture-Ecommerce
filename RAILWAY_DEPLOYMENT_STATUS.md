# Railway Deployment Status

## Current Status

### ✅ Backend (DesignExcellInventory)
- **URL**: https://designexcellinventory-production.up.railway.app
- **Status**: Running and connected to database
- **Port**: 5000
- **Node Version**: 18
- **Health Check**: /api/health
- **Database**: Connected to MSSQL (designxcell-server.database.windows.net)

### ⚠️ Frontend (DesignxcellWebsite)
- **URL**: https://designxcellwebsite-production.up.railway.app
- **Status**: Recently redeployed
- **Node Version**: 18
- **API URL**: Set to https://designexcellinventory-production.up.railway.app

## Recent Issues

### 502 Error on /auth/login
The backend was returning 502 errors, likely due to:
1. Server not fully initialized
2. Routing configuration issues
3. CORS configuration

### Actions Taken
1. ✅ Updated Node.js version to 18 (Railway compatible)
2. ✅ Fixed Three.js dependency conflict (0.172.0)
3. ✅ Added legacy-peer-deps support
4. ✅ Updated CORS configuration
5. ✅ Triggered backend redeployment

## Environment Variables

### Frontend (DesignxcellWebsite)
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://designexcellinventory-production.up.railway.app
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
PORT=3000
```

### Backend (DesignExcellInventory)
```
PORT=5000
DB_PORT=1433
NODE_ENV=production
```

## CORS Configuration

Backend allows the following origins:
- http://localhost:3000
- http://localhost:5000
- https://designxcellwebsite-production.up.railway.app
- https://designexcellinventory-production.up.railway.app

## Next Steps

1. Wait for redeployment to complete (check Railway dashboard)
2. Test the API connection from the frontend
3. Verify login endpoint is working
4. Check Railway logs for any errors

## Deployment Commands

### Deploy Both Services
```bash
# Deploy frontend
cd C:\Final\DesignXcel01
railway up

# Deploy backend
cd C:\Final\DesignXcel01\backend
railway up
```

### Check Logs
```bash
# Frontend logs
railway logs --service DesignxcellWebsite

# Backend logs
railway logs --service DesignExcellInventory
```

## Known Issues

1. **Memory Store Warning**: Backend is using memory session store (not for production)
   - This should be changed to a database-backed session store for production
   - Currently works but sessions won't persist across server restarts

2. **Build Directory**: The frontend needs to be rebuilt to pick up new environment variables
   - React apps compile environment variables at build time
   - Need to trigger a rebuild when env vars change

## Monitoring

Monitor both services through Railway dashboard:
- Project: DesignExcellInventory (Backend)
- Project: DesignxcellWebsite (Frontend)
