# Product ID Security Enhancement

## Overview
This document outlines the security enhancements implemented to address the exposure of internal product IDs in both frontend and backend systems.

## Security Issues Addressed

### 1. **Product ID Exposure in URLs**
- **Before**: URLs like `/product/123` exposed internal database IDs
- **After**: URLs like `/product/modern-wooden-chair` use SEO-friendly slugs

### 2. **Product ID Display in UI**
- **Before**: Product IDs were visible in product detail pages
- **After**: SKUs are displayed instead of internal IDs

### 3. **Backend API Exposure**
- **Before**: APIs returned internal `ProductID` directly
- **After**: APIs return public UUIDs and slugs

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes
- Added `PublicId` column (UNIQUEIDENTIFIER) for public-facing UUIDs
- Added `Slug` column (NVARCHAR(255)) for SEO-friendly URLs
- Added `SKU` column (NVARCHAR(50)) for product identification
- Created indexes for performance
- Added unique constraints

### Frontend Changes
- Updated routes to use `:slug` instead of `:id`
- Modified ProductDetailPage to use slug parameter
- Updated ProductCard to navigate using slugs
- Removed product ID display from UI
- Added product utility functions for UUID/slug handling

### Backend Changes
- Updated API endpoints to support both UUID and slug lookups
- Modified database queries to use new columns
- Added UUID validation logic
- Maintained backward compatibility during transition

## Files Modified

### Frontend Files
- `frontend/src/features/products/pages/ProductDetailPage.js`
- `frontend/src/features/products/components/ProductCard.js`
- `frontend/src/app/routes/public.js`
- `frontend/src/shared/utils/productUtils.js` (new)

### Backend Files
- `backend/server.js`
- `backend/api-routes.js`
- `backend/database/add_product_security_columns.sql` (new)

### Scripts
- `scripts/migrate-product-security.sh` (new)
- `scripts/migrate-product-security.ps1` (new)

## Migration Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
# Linux/Mac
./scripts/migrate-product-security.sh

# Windows PowerShell
.\scripts\migrate-product-security.ps1
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables
Ensure your database connection details are correct in the migration scripts.

### 3. Test the Changes
- Verify product pages load with slug-based URLs
- Check that product IDs are no longer visible in UI
- Test API endpoints with both UUID and slug parameters

## Security Benefits

### 1. **Information Disclosure Prevention**
- Internal database structure is no longer exposed
- Product enumeration attacks are more difficult

### 2. **SEO Improvements**
- URLs are now human-readable and SEO-friendly
- Better user experience with meaningful URLs

### 3. **Business Logic Protection**
- Competitors cannot easily scrape product catalogs
- Internal product relationships are hidden

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains backward compatibility by:
- Supporting both UUID and slug lookups in APIs
- Graceful fallback to existing product IDs during transition
- Maintaining existing cart and checkout functionality

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Product detail pages load with slug URLs
- [ ] Product IDs are not visible in browser address bar
- [ ] Product IDs are not displayed in UI components
- [ ] Cart functionality works with new product structure
- [ ] Checkout process handles new identifiers
- [ ] API endpoints respond to both UUID and slug requests
- [ ] Database migration completed successfully
- [ ] All product links use slug-based navigation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to product API endpoints
2. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication for product access
3. **Audit Logging**: Log product access attempts for security monitoring
4. **Content Security Policy**: Add CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can rollback by:
1. Reverting frontend route changes
2. Updating backend APIs to use original ProductID
3. Removing the new database columns (if needed)
