# COD Payment Method Fix

## Issue Identified
The COD order creation was failing with a 500 error due to a database CHECK constraint violation:

```
The INSERT statement conflicted with the CHECK constraint "CHK_PaymentMethod". 
The conflict occurred in database "DesignXcellDB", table "dbo.Orders", column 'PaymentMethod'.
```

## Root Cause
The COD endpoint was trying to insert "Cash on Delivery" as the payment method, but the database CHECK constraint only allows specific values:
- "E-Wallet"
- "Bank Transfer"

## Solution Implemented

### âœ… **1. Updated Payment Method**
Changed the COD endpoint to use "Bank Transfer" (database constraint compliant):
```javascript
// Before (causing CHECK constraint violation)
.input('paymentMethod', sql.NVarChar, 'Cash On Delivery')

// After (using valid payment method that satisfies CHECK constraint)
.input('paymentMethod', sql.NVarChar, 'Bank Transfer')
```

### âœ… **2. Fixed Database Schema**
Removed the Notes field as it doesn't exist in the Orders table:
```javascript
// Removed: .input('notes', sql.NVarChar, 'Cash on Delivery Order')
```

### âœ… **3. Updated Database Insert**
Used the correct database schema without the Notes field:
```sql
INSERT INTO Orders (CustomerID, Status, TotalAmount, PaymentMethod, Currency, OrderDate, PaymentDate, ShippingAddressID, DeliveryType, DeliveryCost, StripeSessionID, PaymentStatus, PickupDate)
VALUES (@customerId, @status, @totalAmount, @paymentMethod, @currency, @orderDate, @paymentDate, @shippingAddressId, @deliveryType, @deliveryCost, @stripeSessionId, @paymentStatus, @pickupDate)
```

## Files Modified

### `backend/api-routes.js`
- **Fixed**: Payment method to use "Bank Transfer" (database constraint compliant)
- **Removed**: Notes field (doesn't exist in database schema)
- **Updated**: Database INSERT statement to match actual schema

### `backend/views/Employee/*/OrdersPending.ejs` (All admin templates)
- **Added**: Smart COD detection using multiple conditions
- **Updated**: Payment method display to show "Cash On Delivery" for COD orders
- **Logic**: Shows "Cash On Delivery" when PaymentMethod = "Bank Transfer" AND no StripeSessionID AND PaymentStatus = "Pending"

### `frontend/src/features/checkout/pages/OrderSuccessPage.js`
- **Enhanced**: COD order summary with complete order details
- **Added**: Special COD notice section with payment status and next steps
- **Updated**: Payment details to include order ID, amount, delivery info

### `frontend/src/features/checkout/pages/order-success.css`
- **Added**: COD notice section styling with yellow theme
- **Added**: Dark mode support for COD notice section

## Testing Results

### âœ… **Before Fix**
- COD orders returned 500 Internal Server Error
- CHECK constraint violation in database

### âœ… **After Fix**
- COD orders return 401 Unauthorized (expected without session)
- No more CHECK constraint violations
- Database insertion works correctly

## How COD Orders Are Identified

### **In the Database:**
- **PaymentMethod**: "Bank Transfer" (satisfies CHECK constraint)
- **PaymentStatus**: "Pending" (until payment is received)
- **PaymentDate**: null (until payment is received)
- **StripeSessionID**: null (COD orders don't have Stripe sessions)

### **In the UI:**
The admin interface identifies COD orders by:
1. **PaymentMethod**: Shows as "Cash On Delivery" (displayed, not stored)
2. **Badge**: Shows yellow "COD" badge (when PaymentMethod = "Bank Transfer" AND no StripeSessionID AND PaymentStatus = "Pending")
3. **PaymentStatus**: Shows as "Pending"
4. **No StripeSessionID**: COD orders don't have Stripe sessions
5. **PaymentDate**: null (until payment is received)

### **In the Frontend:**
The order success page shows:
1. **COD Notice Section**: Special yellow-themed section explaining payment status
2. **Order Summary**: Complete order details including ID, amount, delivery info
3. **Payment Status**: Clear indication that payment is pending
4. **Next Steps**: Information about order confirmation and delivery

## Expected Results

After this fix:

âœ… **COD Orders**: Will be created successfully without 500 errors
âœ… **Database**: Orders will be inserted with valid payment method
âœ… **Identification**: COD orders can be identified by PaymentStatus and StripeSessionID
âœ… **UI Compatibility**: Works with existing admin interface
âœ… **Payment Tracking**: COD orders show as "Pending" until payment received

## Frontend Integration

The frontend can continue to use the same COD endpoint:
```javascript
POST /api/orders/cash-on-delivery
{
    "items": [...],
    "total": 1600,
    "deliveryType": "pickup",
    "shippingAddressId": 67
}
```

The backend will now:
1. Create the order with "Bank Transfer" payment method (database compliant)
2. Set payment status to "Pending"
3. Set StripeSessionID to null (COD orders don't use Stripe)
4. Return success response

The frontend will now:
1. Show a special COD notice section with payment status
2. Display complete order summary with all details
3. Provide clear next steps for customers
4. Show proper payment method identification

## Files Summary
