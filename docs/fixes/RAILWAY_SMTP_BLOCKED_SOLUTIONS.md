# Railway SMTP Blocked - Complete Solutions Guide

## The Problem

Railway **blocks all SMTP ports** (25, 465, 587, 2525) for security reasons.

**Your Error:**
```
Error: Connection timeout
code: 'ETIMEDOUT'
command: 'CONN'
```

This means Railway won't let your backend connect to Gmail's SMTP servers.

- Node.js installed

### Steps:
1. **Run backend locally:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Expose to internet with ngrok:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000
   ```
   
3. **Update frontend .env:**
   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io

4. **Redeploy frontend only**

**Cons:** 
- Need PC running 24/7
