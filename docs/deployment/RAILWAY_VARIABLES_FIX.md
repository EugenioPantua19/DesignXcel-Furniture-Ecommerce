# Railway Environment Variables Fix - OTP Email Issue

## Issue Resolved

**Problem:** OTP emails were not being sent on production website because Railway environment variables still had the Gmail App Password **with spaces**.

**Root Cause:** While we updated the `.env` and `.env.railway` files, the Railway platform itself stores environment variables separately. The old value with spaces was still active.

---

## What Was Wrong

### Railway Backend Variables (Before Fix)
```bash
OTP_EMAIL_USER=design.xcel01@gmail.com
OTP_EMAIL_PASS=mdvc ebdd axqj lhug  ❌ (WITH SPACES - WRONG!)
```

### Railway Frontend Variables (Before Fix)
```bash
# Frontend had these variables (not needed, but had wrong value)
OTP_EMAIL_USER=design.xcel01@gmail.com
OTP_EMAIL_PASS=mdvc ebdd axqj lhug  ❌ (WITH SPACES - WRONG!)
```

---

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ Backend Railway Variables
```bash
# Updated using Railway CLI
railway variables --set OTP_EMAIL_PASS=mdvcebddaxqjlhug
```

**Result:**
```
OTP_EMAIL_USER=design.xcel01@gmail.com
OTP_EMAIL_PASS=mdvcebddaxqjlhug  ✅ (NO SPACES - CORRECT!)
```

### ✅ Redeployed Both Services

1. **Backend Redeployed**
   - Build Logs: [Railway Backend Deployment](https://railway.com/project/f5c6c515-6c34-42c7-9a17-192a9065ebf8/service/862c55c8-0482-49e4-8dad-bb8f5c1dc431?id=4dab2732-fc4a-4bec-8b58-6be0ea4834f7)
   - Status: ✅ Deployed with correct OTP password

2. **Frontend Redeployed**
   - Build Logs: [Railway Frontend Deployment](https://railway.com/project/5dda0af3-b96a-45d6-8c5d-3c4fe328a536/service/c6140f2d-34da-4b7d-b59f-1e4d83079154?id=a0a2eadb-844a-4ffd-87d9-fc9d798f13a7)
   - Status: ✅ Deployed with updated configuration

## How Railway Variables Work

### Important Distinction

There are **THREE** places where environment variables exist:

1. **Local `.env` file** (for local development)
   - Located at: `backend/.env`
   - Used when running locally: `npm start`
   - ✅ We fixed this

2. **Railway `.env.railway` file** (template for Railway)
   - Located at: `backend/.env.railway`
   - Used as reference during deployment
   - ✅ We fixed this

3. **Railway Platform Variables** (actual production environment)
   - Stored in Railway's dashboard/database
   - These are the **ACTUAL** variables used in production
   - ⚠️ These were STILL wrong until now
   - ✅ We fixed this using `railway variables --set`

### Why All Three Need to Match

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Development (.env)                                           │
│ → Used when: npm start locally                               │
│ → Purpose: Local testing                                     │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Railway Template (.env.railway)                             │
│ → Used when: railway up (reads from this file)               │
│ → Purpose: Template for Railway deployment                   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Railway Platform Variables                                   │
│ → Used when: Production app runs on Railway                  │
│ → Purpose: ACTUAL production environment                     │
│ → NOTE: Persists between deployments unless changed          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Commands Used to Fix

### 1. Check Current Variables
```bash
# In backend directory
cd backend
railway variables

# Shows all current Railway variables
# Found: OTP_EMAIL_PASS=mdvc ebdd axqj lhug (with spaces)
```

### 2. Update Variable
```bash
# Set the correct password (no spaces)
railway variables --set OTP_EMAIL_PASS=mdvcebddaxqjlhug

# Output: Set variables OTP_EMAIL_PASS
```

### 3. Redeploy Backend
```bash
railway up --detach

# Forces Railway to restart with new variable values
```

### 4. Redeploy Frontend
```bash
cd ../frontend
railway up --detach

# Ensures frontend has latest configuration
```

## Current Variable Status

### Backend (DesignExcellInventory)

**Critical Variables:**
```bash
✅ NODE_ENV=production
✅ PORT=5000
✅ DB_CONNECTION_STRING=[Azure SQL Connection]
✅ OTP_EMAIL_USER=design.xcel01@gmail.com
✅ OTP_EMAIL_PASS=mdvcebddaxqjlhug (NO SPACES - FIXED!)
✅ FRONTEND_URL=https://designxcellwebsite-production.up.railway.app
✅ CORS_ORIGIN=https://designxcellwebsite-production.up.railway.app
✅ JWT_SECRET=[Secure secret]
✅ SESSION_SECRET=[Secure secret]
✅ STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[Test key]
✅ STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=[Webhook secret]
```

### Frontend (DesignxcellWebsite)

**Critical Variables:**
```bash
✅ REACT_APP_API_URL=https://designexcellinventory-production.up.railway.app
✅ REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
✅ REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[Stripe key]
✅ GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
✅ DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN=true
✅ CI=false
```

**Note:** Frontend doesn't need `OTP_EMAIL_USER` and `OTP_EMAIL_PASS` (only backend uses these). They exist in frontend but are not used.

## Why This Happened

### Timeline of Events

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Set up `.env` files with OTP credentials
   - Gmail app password displayed with spaces: `mdvc ebdd axqj lhug`
   - Copied directly into `.env` file with spaces

2. **First Deployment**
   - Deployed to Railway using `railway up`
   - Railway stored variables with spaces

3. **We Fixed `.env` Files**
   - Removed spaces from `.env` and `.env.railway`
   - Redeployed using `railway up`
   - **BUT**: Railway kept old variable values!

4. **Final Fix**
   - Used `railway variables --set` to update Railway platform
   - Redeployed both services
   - **NOW**: Everything aligned and working!

### Key Lesson

**When you deploy to Railway:**
- `railway up` reads from `.env.railway` file
- But if variable already exists on Railway platform, it **keeps the old value**
- You must explicitly update using `railway variables --set` to change existing variables
- Or delete and redeploy, or use Railway dashboard

## Files Updated

### 1. Backend Environment Files
- ✅ `backend/.env` - Already fixed (no spaces)
- ✅ `backend/.env.railway` - Already fixed (no spaces)
- ✅ **Railway Platform Variables** - NOW fixed (no spaces)

### 2. Commands Executed
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
railway variables --set OTP_EMAIL_PASS=mdvcebddaxqjlhug
railway up --detach

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
railway up --detach
```
