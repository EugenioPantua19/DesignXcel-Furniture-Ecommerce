# Railway Deployment Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **COD Order Creation 500 Error**
- **Problem**: COD orders failing with 500 server error
- **Root Cause**: Missing required database fields in Orders table insert
- **Fix**: Updated COD endpoint with complete database schema

### 2. **OTP Email Not Sending During Sign Up**
- **Problem**: OTP emails not being sent during registration
- **Root Cause**: Registration bypassed OTP verification entirely
- **Fix**: Created OTP-based registration endpoint

## Files Modified (Need Deployment)

### `backend/api-routes.js`
- ✅ **Fixed COD endpoint** with complete database schema
- ✅ **Added enhanced error handling** and logging
- ✅ **Fixed timezone handling** (Manila time)

### `backend/routes.js`
- ✅ **Added OTP-based registration endpoint** (`/api/auth/customer/register-with-otp`)
- ✅ **Fixed OTP sending endpoint** syntax error
- ✅ **Added debug endpoints** for troubleshooting
- ✅ **Enhanced OTP verification** with cleanup

## Environment Variables Status

### ✅ **Correctly Set in Railway**
```bash
# Email Configuration
OTP_EMAIL_USER=design.xcel01@gmail.com
OTP_EMAIL_PASS=mdvc ebdd axqj lhug

# Database Configuration
DB_SERVER=designxcell-server.database.windows.net
DB_USERNAME=designxcell
DB_PASSWORD=Azwrath22@
DB_DATABASE=DesignXcellDB

# Other required variables are set
```

## Deployment Instructions

### **Option 1: Using Railway CLI**
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Deploy to Railway
railway up --detach

# Check deployment status
railway status
```

### **Option 2: Using PowerShell Script**
```powershell
# Run the deployment script
.\deploy-fixes-to-railway.ps1
```

### **Option 3: Manual Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your backend project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Deploy" to trigger new deployment

## Testing After Deployment

### **1. Test Server Health**
```bash
curl https://designexcellinventory-production.up.railway.app/api/health
```

### **2. Test Environment Variables**
```bash
curl https://designexcellinventory-production.up.railway.app/api/debug/env-check
```

### **3. Test OTP Email**
```bash
curl -X POST https://designexcellinventory-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/test-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com"}'
```

### **4. Test COD Order (Should return 401 without auth)**
```bash
curl -X POST https://designexcellinventory-production.up.railway.app/api/orders/cash-on-delivery \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"items":[{"id":1,"quantity":1,"price":100}],"total":100}'
```

## Expected Results After Deployment

### ✅ **COD Orders**
- Should work without 500 errors
- Proper database insertion with all required fields
- Enhanced error messages for debugging

### ✅ **OTP Emails**
- Should be sent successfully to user emails
- OTP-based registration available
- Email verification required for sign up

### ✅ **Debug Endpoints**
- Environment variable checking
- Server health monitoring
- Better error logging

## Troubleshooting

### **If deployment fails:**
1. Check Railway CLI is installed and logged in
2. Verify Railway project permissions
3. Check Railway logs for deployment errors

### **If COD orders still fail:**
1. Check Railway logs for specific error messages
2. Verify database connection
3. Test with authenticated user session

### **If OTP emails don't send:**
1. Check Railway environment variables
2. Verify Gmail app password is correct
3. Check Railway logs for email sending errors

## Files Summary

### **Modified Files (Need Deployment)**
- ✅ `backend/api-routes.js` - COD endpoint fixes
- ✅ `backend/routes.js` - OTP registration fixes
- ✅ `backend/scripts/test-*.js` - Test scripts
- ✅ `deploy-fixes-to-railway.ps1` - Deployment script

### **Documentation**
- ✅ `COD_ORDER_FIX.md` - COD fix details
- ✅ `OTP_REGISTRATION_FIX.md` - OTP fix details
- ✅ `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md` - This file

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the fixes** using one of the methods above
2. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete
3. **Test the endpoints** using the test commands
4. **Verify functionality** in the frontend application
5. **Check Railway logs** if any issues persist

The fixes are ready and just need to be deployed to Railway to resolve both the COD order and OTP email issues.
