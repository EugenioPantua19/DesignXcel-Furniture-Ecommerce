# Discount Functionality Fix - Frontend Display Issue

## Problem Identified

The discount functionality was not working on the frontend because:

1. **Missing Discount Data**: The `/api/products` endpoint (used by product lists, catalog, home page) was not including discount information
2. **Frontend Fallback**: Since the backend couldn't provide products with discounts, the frontend fell back to mock data which had no discount information
3. **Inconsistent API Structure**: Only the individual product endpoint (`/api/products/:id`) included discount data, but the list endpoints did not

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Backend API Updates

#### `/api/products` Endpoint (api-routes.js)

- Added LEFT JOIN with ProductDiscounts table
- Included discount fields: `DiscountID`, `DiscountType`, `DiscountValue`, `StartDate`, `EndDate`
- Added calculated fields: `discountedPrice`, `discountAmount`
- Added date filtering: `GETDATE() BETWEEN pd.StartDate AND pd.EndDate`
- Added proper NULL handling for products without discounts

#### `/api/products/search` Endpoint (search-api-fix.js)

- Same discount information added to search results
- Ensures search results show discounted prices

### 2. Frontend Component Updates

#### ProductCard.js

- Already properly configured to handle the new discount structure
- Uses `hasDiscount` and `discountInfo` properties

#### ProductCatalog.js

- Updated price filtering to use new discount structure
- Updated sorting logic to use discounted prices

#### useSearch.js

- Updated price filtering and relevance scoring to use new discount structure

#### Header.js

- Updated search result display to show discounted prices

### 3. Data Structure

The new discount structure returned by the API:

```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Product Name",
  price: 1000.00,
  hasDiscount: true,
  discountInfo: {
    discountId: 1,
    discountType: "percentage", // or "fixed"
    discountValue: 25, // 25% or fixed amount
    startDate: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    endDate: "2024-12-31T23:59:59.000Z",
    discountedPrice: 750.00, // calculated discounted price
    discountAmount: 250.00 // amount saved
  }
}
```

## How to Test

### 1. Backend Test

1. Go to Admin CMS → Products tab
2. Set a discount on any product (percentage or fixed amount)
3. Ensure the discount dates are current (start date ≤ today ≤ end date)

### 2. Frontend Test

1. Open the frontend in your browser
2. Open Developer Tools → Console
3. Run the test script: `testDiscountFunctionality()`
4. Check the console output for:
   - ✅ Products API working
   - Products with discounts count
   - Sample product structure

### 3. Visual Test

1. Go to the home page - featured products should show discounted prices
2. Go to products catalog - products with discounts should show:
   - Discounted price in red
   - Original price crossed out
   - Discount percentage badge
3. Search for products - search results should show discounted prices
4. Individual product pages should show discount information

## Files Modified

### Backend

- `backend/api-routes.js` - Updated `/api/products` endpoint
- `backend/search-api-fix.js` - Updated search endpoint

### Frontend

- `frontend/src/pages/ProductCatalog.js` - Updated price filtering and sorting
- `frontend/src/hooks/useSearch.js` - Updated search logic
- `frontend/src/components/common/Header.js` - Updated search results display

### Test Files

- `test-discount-frontend.js` - Test script for verification

## Expected Results

After the fix:

1. **Product Lists**: All product listing pages should show discounted prices
2. **Search Results**: Search results should include discount information
3. **Featured Products**: Home page featured products should show discounts
4. **Product Cards**: Discount badges and crossed-out original prices should appear
5. **Consistent Behavior**: All product displays should show the same discount information

## Troubleshooting

If discounts still don't appear:

1. **Check Database**: Verify discounts exist in `ProductDiscounts` table
2. **Check Dates**: Ensure discount start/end dates are current
3. **Check API**: Test `/api/products` endpoint directly
4. **Check Console**: Look for JavaScript errors in browser console
5. **Check Network**: Verify API calls are returning discount data

## Notes

- The fix ensures that only active discounts within their date range are displayed
- Products without discounts will have `hasDiscount: false` and `discountInfo: null`
- The frontend gracefully handles both discounted and non-discounted products
- All price calculations (filtering, sorting, display) now use the discounted price when available
