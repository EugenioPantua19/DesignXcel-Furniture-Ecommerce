## 🛠️ **Technical Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Authentication System Fixed**
- **Before**: Mock authentication with hardcoded user ID 1
- **After**: Real database authentication with proper bcrypt verification
- **Result**: Customers can now login with actual credentials

### 2. **Password Verification Enhanced**
- **Before**: Simple string comparison (insecure)
- **After**: Proper bcrypt password hashing verification
- **Result**: Secure authentication matching database password hashes

### 3. **Session Management Aligned**
- **Backend**: Session-based authentication with database lookup
- **Frontend**: Compatible with session-based authentication
- **Result**: Seamless authentication flow

### 4. **Database Schema Verified**
- **Orders Table**: Proper structure with delivery information
- **OrderItems Table**: Correct product relationships
- **Foreign Keys**: All constraints working properly

## 🚀 **System Architecture**

### **Backend API Endpoints**
```
✅ POST /api/auth/customer/login - Customer authentication
✅ GET /api/auth/validate-session - Session validation
✅ POST /api/orders/cash-on-delivery - Cash-on-delivery orders
✅ POST /api/stripe/webhook - Stripe payment processing
✅ GET /api/customer/orders-with-items - Order retrieval
✅ PUT /api/customer/orders/:id/receive - Mark order received
✅ PUT /api/customer/orders/:id/cancel - Cancel order
```

### **Database Schema**
```sql
Orders Table:
- OrderID (Primary Key)
- CustomerID (Foreign Key to Customers)
- Status (Pending, Processing, Shipping, Delivered, Completed, Cancelled)
- PaymentMethod (Cash on Delivery, Credit Card)
- TotalAmount (Decimal)
- OrderDate (DateTime)
- DeliveryType (pickup, rate_X)
- DeliveryCost (Decimal)
- ShippingAddressID (Foreign Key to CustomerAddresses)

OrderItems Table:
- OrderItemID (Primary Key)
- OrderID (Foreign Key to Orders)
- ProductID (Foreign Key to Products)
- Quantity (Int)
- PriceAtPurchase (Decimal)
```

### **Authentication Flow**
```
1. Customer logs in with email/password
2. Backend verifies credentials against database using bcrypt
3. Session created with customer information
4. Frontend receives session cookie
5. Subsequent API calls use session authentication
6. Orders retrieved based on authenticated customer ID
```
